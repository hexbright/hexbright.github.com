        <p>On May 2011 I launched a Kickstarter campaign for a rechargeable and
        programmable flashlight where users could write and trade their own
        code. It was the first open source flashlight and although plenty of
        people thought it was a crazy idea, many more thought it was great. We
        called it the HexBright and it finished in the top ten most funded
        Kickstarter projects back in 2011. Four years later that idea has run
        its course. Sadly, we are shutting down production of the original
        HexBright Flex. From the bottom of my heart I thank all the original
        backers and all the others who sought out this unique flashlight.</p>
